Hello fellow traveller üëã 

Welcome to "One Thing We Learned Today." This simple little corner of the internet is maintained by the same people who work on the [Markets by Zerodha YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@marketsbyzerodha/videos) and all the shows and newsletters associated with it, like The Daily Brief.

We are a small team of 5-6 people who love learning new things about markets, finance, economy, and all the weird and fascinating things associated with them. In the order of most to least annoying (bonus points if you can guess who wrote this intro üòÄ), the team consists of:

1. [Kashish Kapoor (Kasis)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kashishkap00r/), alias Kasis, is a guy with the remarkable talent of butchering normal English words like "interesting". He‚Äôs the Kamala Harris of YouTube hosts ‚Äî he was nobody‚Äôs first choice to begin with, and yet, he somehow loses popularity with every appearance he makes.

2. [Krishna Lohia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishnalohiaaa/), alias Raju, is a non-biological twin of Kasis and is on a quest to be as minimally brain-celled as Kasis. He also hosts the show "Who Said What". Despite the rather limited grey matter in his brain, along with Anurag, he keeps this entire initiative going.

3. [Anurag Bansal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anurag28bansal/) is the first-choice host of The Daily Brief and lends his voice to everything the team writes. He's also responsible for the recovery of views on our channel after Kasis hosts a show.

4. Pranav Agarwal is our resident wordsmith who writes some of the most pointlessly flowery English on this side of Asia. He's the only North Indian to use the word "alas" in a blog post. He also edited this page. So if it sucks, you know who to blame.

5. [Shubham Sadaphal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham-sadaphal-082617212/) is the sole parent of the awesome show and newsletter "Beyond the Charts." He's also one of the most hardworking people on the team and makes sure this entire enterprise runs like it's skating on a bar of Amul makkhan.

6. [Tharun Iyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tharun-iyer-70b804220) is the most cursed member of the team. Even walking with nimbu-mirchi around his neck can‚Äôt ward off the pungent stench of ill-luck he gives off. He used to host the show "World Simplified," but we aborted it (because nobody watched it). He's currently an honorary member of the team so that he doesn't feel bad.

7. [Bhavya Dua](https://in.linkedin.com/in/bhavya-dua) is the host of ‚ÄúThe Big Perspective‚Äù and also makes the rest of people look sane and normal.

8. [Bhuvan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bebhuvan/) the conductor that runs this whole orchestra. He set up this site, and signs the paychecks of everyone above. He‚Äôs the least annoying person on the team, because nobody dares suggest otherwise. 

None of us are 'experts' on the things we talk about. All the shows on our YouTube channel force us to constantly learn new things, and expand and update what we know. They send us down weird and fascinating rabbit holes, and by the end of each day, we're usually a little less dumb than when we started. That's precisely why this is so fulfilling ‚Äî we get to learn new things and share them with the world.

The purpose of setting up this website is to share things we learn each day. We all learn from others who so generously share knowledge for free on the internet, and we want to pay it forward. Our other selfish objective is that we want more people to think about finance, but it's so damn intimidating. So we set up this website to share one thing we all learn each day and write about it.

The hope here is that learning one thing is less intimidating than diving headfirst into the messy, maddening, exhilarating world of finance. We want you to have the same feeling of giddy joy we all have when we discover a new rabbit hole to go down.

So we genuinely hope you find weird and interesting rabbit holes to go down üêá 

Happy hunting!

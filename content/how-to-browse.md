One of the inspirations for setting up this little space was [digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/). This is less of a blog and more of a space that will continue to grow, change, and evolve over time. Another goal behind creating this site was to spark curiosity and a desire for exploration.

Don't think of the posts here as snapshots in time, but rather as starting points to dive headfirst into a rabbit hole. You can begin browsing by exploring the [archive](https://onethingwelearned.today/archive), [tags](https://onethingwelearned.today/tags/), or by [searching](https://onethingwelearned.today/search/) for something.

This site won't have a newsletter. However, if you want to be notified about new posts, you can subscribe to the site's [RSS feed](https://onethingwelearned.today/atom.xml) and read it on apps like Feedly. Even the Substack app supports [external RSS feeds](https://on.substack.com/p/new-web-reader?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=1eft5&triedRedirect=true) and you can read One Thing We Learned Today along with all your other newsletters.

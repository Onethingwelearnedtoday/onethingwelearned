One of the inspirations for setting up this little space was [digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/). This is less of a blog and more of a space that will continue to grow, change, and evolve over time. Another goal behind creating this site was to spark curiosity and a desire for exploration.

Don't think of the posts here as snapshots in time, but rather as starting points to dive headfirst into a rabbit hole. You can begin browsing by exploring the [archive](https://onethingwelearned.today/archive), [tags](https://onethingwelearned.today/tags/), or by [searching](https://onethingwelearned.today/search/) for something.

One of the inspirations for setting up this little space was digital gardening. This is less of a blog and more of a space that will continue to grow, change, and evolve over time. Another goal behind creating this site was to spark curiosity and a desire for exploration.

Don't think of the posts here as snapshots in time, but rather as starting points to dive headfirst into a rabbit hole. You can begin browsing by exploring the archive, tags, or by searching for something.

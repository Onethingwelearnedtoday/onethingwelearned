## Tharun—The hunt for the perfect employee: Rarity of exceptional people

Have you ever noticed how companies are constantly searching for that one perfect employee? You know, the superhuman who can do everything - and they're willing to pay any price for them. If you're a manager, you've probably been on this hunt too. But here's the thing: finding this person feels impossible, right? Almost like searching for a unicorn.

Think about it - companies want someone who can:

- Learn, think, and solve problems quickly
- Stay responsible, organized, and hardworking
- Handle pressure like a pro and manage stress effortlessly

If you're wondering why your team seems filled with "just" average or above-average people, there's now actually a scientific explanation. Want to take a wild guess at how rare these perfect employees are? 1 in 100,000? Maybe 1 in a million? Well, you're close, but according to this [scientific paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188692400415X/pdfft?md5=a3e5a88bd7c78131ca7c6b09ebb26df5&pid=1-s2.0-S019188692400415X-main.pdf) from Associate Professor Gilles E. Gignac from the School of Psychological Science at the University of Western Australia, it's actually 1 in 20 million! That means there are only about 400 such people in the entire world. Good luck finding them - you probably have better chances of stumbling upon an actual unicorn.

Now how was this study conducted?

The study looked at three key traits that predict success in work, life, and relationships:

- Intelligence: Your ability to learn, think critically, and solve problems
- Conscientiousness: Being responsible, organized, and hardworking
- Emotional Stability: Staying calm under pressure and handling stress well

So how rare are these "dream candidates" that companies keep searching for? Let’s break it down.

- Notable (Above Average - 16%)

These are your solid performers - quick learners who work hard and stay level-headed. They're the ones keeping companies running smoothly, even though they might fly under the radar for not being "extraordinary." But hey, being above average in all three traits already puts you in the top 16%.

- Remarkable (1 Level Up - 0.94%)

Now we're talking real standout employees. Less than 1 in 100 people hit this level. They're the ones who always think two steps ahead, never miss deadlines, and handle pressure like they're on a vacation.

- Exceptional (2 Levels Up - 0.0085%)

This is the super rare breed. We're talking 85 people in a million. These folks are learning machines with unmatched discipline and they stay cooler under pressure than Bangalore's weather. Think about it - in a city of a million people, you'd barely find 85 of them.

- Profoundly Exceptional (3 Levels Up - 1 in 20 Million)

Now we've reached the unicorn level - the employee every company dreams of. We're talking about someone who can perform magic on stage, play the guitar, dominate at badminton, make videos, AND maintain a six-pack... all while answering emails. I can do all of these, by the way. Oh, and did I mention their most important trait is being humble? Just like me - I'm incredibly humble and down-to-earth. You know, the most humble person you'll ever meet!

But jokes aside a profoundly exceptional person is not just a genius, not just highly disciplined, not just emotionally stable—but all three at the same time. With only 400 of these people on earth, the chances of you winning the Kerala lottery is higher.

Now why does this matter? Well because recruitment and employee expectations need to change.

- First, even finding someone who's above average across all three traits is much rarer than most people realize. Companies need to start appreciating these employees more.
- Second, recruiters should remember that just because someone's super intelligent doesn't mean they'll automatically be disciplined or emotionally strong. It's like assuming someone who's great at singing will also be great at cooking.

So to all the companies and managers, stop chasing unicorns and start appreciating your above-average employees. They're already more special than you might think.

Also, if in your next appraisal your manager tells you were "above average but not exceptional," send them this article :)

## Krishna—The man who vanished billions**

Hopefully, tomorrow brings something that has nothing to do with DeepSeek for a change. 

Today, I came across an article by Gregory Zuckerman, the author of the well-known book on the late Jim Simons—the man behind Renaissance Technologies, who generated extraordinary returns of around 66**% annually over 40 years.** There’s a nice Acquired episode on [this](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/renaissance-technologies).

In his article, Gregory mentions that he hadn’t read much about DeepSeek, nor had he been following it. So when people were tagging him on social media on stuff related to DeepSeek he thought it was some kind of altcoin. Turns out, the reason was that *Liang* ****had written the preface to the Chinese translation of Gregory’s book.

Liang wrote: “Whenever I encounter difficulties at work, I recall Simons’s words: ‘There must be a way to model prices.’” 

The man, Liang, whose side project wiped away billions from US’s market is a big fan of [the man who solved the markets](https://www.amazon.in/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X).

## Anurag— Working women in India**

I recently [read](https://www.dataforindia.com/female-lfpr-change/) about how more women in India are joining the workforce again. After staying low for years and dropping sharply after 2005, female labour force participation has picked up once again in the last five years. This, of course, is a big shift because, for a long time, women in India have been underrepresented in the workforce.

![Labour force participation over time](/images/labour-force-participation-over-time.jpg)

Men in India have always had much higher participation in the workforce than women, nearly twice as much. Over time, male participation has slightly declined, while female participation has gone up and down more sharply. Among women, rural participation has been more unpredictable than urban. Rural women have always been more likely to work, but after 2005, many of them left the workforce, mostly because they moved out of agriculture. Recently, 50 million rural women have returned to farm work, bringing their participation back to early 2000s levels. In cities, the increase has been slower but steady, mainly due to more job opportunities in the services sector.

One big reason women move in and out of the workforce is household work. When fewer women work, more of them say their main activity is taking care of their homes. When more women work, fewer report being engaged in housework. Right now, the number of women listing housework as their primary activity is the lowest it has ever been.

The kind of work women do has also changed over time. In the 1980s and 1990s, many rural women worked as unpaid helpers in family farms or businesses. By 2005, nearly half of all working rural women were unpaid helpers. But the recent rise in female employment has been different. More women are now self-employed, meaning they are earning their own wages rather than working without pay. While agriculture still dominates in rural India, urban jobs have increasingly come from the services sector, which has been growing steadily for both men and women.

![Urban employment](/images/urban-employment.jpg)

Men’s participation in the workforce has slightly declined, but for a different reason. Since the 1980s, more men have been enrolling in education, which has gradually pulled them out of the workforce. Unlike women, most men have historically worked, so their exit has been slower and mainly due to studying.

Another key trend in India’s workforce is the rise of self-employment. More workers, especially women, are choosing to be self-employed rather than working salaried jobs. This shift is happening in both cities and villages. In rural areas, most of the recent increase in female employment has come from short-term or seasonal work. In urban areas, the rise in employment has mostly been in long-term jobs.

![Nature of employment](/images/nature-of-employment.jpg)

Even though India’s female workforce participation is still low compared to other countries, the recent increase shows a change in social and economic trends. With more women earning their own income and becoming self-employed, the way work looks in India could very quickly be evolving.
